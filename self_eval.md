# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators?
Scale of 1-10 I feel like a 10.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators?
I believe I have full understanding on these. 10.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements?
I have strong comprehension on if statements. I would rate myself an 8. I can execute all the commands but may have to reference notes from time to time to ensure proper code language.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate?
Roughly 2 hours total spent. I feel like this was slower than anticipated. I am feeling like small getting code to run was the main cause of this taking more than 1 hour. I understood all the concepts really well, was running into output errors related to not deleting certain text from questions and then was confused as to why I wasnt getting line breaks when running the code. I then realized I was using `print` rather than `puts`
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
Minor attention to details on the code sheet. Key concepts are coming easily, but I am overlooking small detail for execution.
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
Feeling good thus far!
